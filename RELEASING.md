## Guidelines

1. Rusoto [has a CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to track what's in releases.
2. Releases are tracked [in GitHub](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto/releases).

Before hitting 1.0, the public API has no backwards compatibility guaranteed.

After 1.0, the public API will be stable for the 1.0 releases. If we need to break the public API, Rusoto 2.0 will be started. Patches will be back ported to the 1.x branch.

## Release trains

For pre-1.0.0:

* Targeting one release a month for minor versions.
* Regression bug fixes will be released ASAP on best effort for maintainers.  For example, a regression in 0.9.0 means 0.9.1 is released ASAP instead of waiting for the next release train.

## Release procedure for Rusoto

### Semantic versioning

Rusoto uses [semantic versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

### Publishing walkthrough:

1. Make a pull request that bumps version numbers for `rusoto_core`, `rusoto_credential` and `rusoto_mock` if needed and each service that changed since previous release.  Service versions are in the `services.json` file in the codegen project. Otherwise they are in the `Cargo.toml` files for each project.  Make sure the root Rusoto README example gets updated with the new version. The `skeptical` package will also need to be set to use the new version of Rusoto.
2. Merge release PR.
3. Publish new version of `rusoto_credential` if changes have been made to it.
4. Publish new version of `rusoto_mock` if changes have been made to it.
5. Publish new version of `rusoto_core` if it changes have been made to it.
6. Run `publish-services.sh` in the `rusoto/services` dir. *Warning*: takes >2 hours on a low end Macbook. The script can be run again if an issue comes up without problems - crates.io prevents republishing.
7. Tag master branch with the new version.  Example: `git tag -a rusoto-v0.21.0 -m "Rusoto 0.21.0 release."` then `git push --tags origin`.

### Git tags

Due to multiple crates being in the repo, releases for each crate will be in the format `crate-vmajor.minor.patch`.

Examples:

* `rusoto-v0.21.0`
* `credentials-v0.3.0`
* `mock-v0.27.0`
